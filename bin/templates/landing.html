<p>I wrote Pigeon in the Go programming language as a learning project and as an experimental communication platform.</p>
<p>It's just like a regular messaging platform, except that messages only appear in the recipient's mailbox after an artificial two day delay period.</p>
<p>Yep, we're using modern internet tech to emulate snail mail. Retro nostalgia culture gone amock!</p>
<p>Feel free to sign up and give it a try. I wouldn't count on any of your messages being saved long term, though I'll make sure and give you a copy if you happen to join.</p>
<p>See more of my work on my <a href="https://github.com/csmoulaison">github account</a> and my <a href="https://www.connermoulaison.com/">personal website</a>.</p>
